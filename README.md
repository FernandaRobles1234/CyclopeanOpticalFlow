## Project Description

Cyclopean Optical Flow is a novel approach to determine the apparent motion patterns in stereo imagery. This Matematica implementation aims to develop with efficiency for later implementation in C++ to provide real-time processing of stereo images to extract valuable information regarding their motion dynamics.

## Usage

In development.
